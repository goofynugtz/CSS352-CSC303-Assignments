# Linked List

## Assignment 1
1. Write an algorithm for inserting an element in a singly linked linear list before a node whose value is ```val```.  
   Consider different possible scenarios for insertion:  
    a. at the  beginning,  
    b. in the middle,  
    c. at the end or  
    d. may not be inserted.

## Assignment 2
1. Write an interactive C program with the following two functions.  
    a. Concatenate two given lists ```head1``` and ```head2``` into a list ```head```.  
    b. A linked list ```head``` is given which is sorted. Insert a given element in the list head so that after insertion, the list is also sorted.
  
2. Write a C program for insertion sort using singly linked linear list.  
   Consider the list is initially empty, then insert the element one by calling the function 1 (a), mentioned above, repeatedly.
