# Assignment 1
1. Write a C program to find whether a specified element say, ITEM, is present in a given singly linked linear list or not. If the element ITEM is found, then report the position of ITEM within the list, else report “ITEM not found”.

2. Write a C program for inserting an element in a singly linked linear list head before a node whose data value is val. Consider the different possible scenarios for insertion
-	at the beginning,
-	in the middle,
-	at the end,
-	list may be empty, or
-	may not be required to insert.

3. Write a C program for deletion of an element from a singly linked linear list head before a node whose data value is val. Consider different possible scenarios for deletion. 

4. Write an interactive C program with the following two functions.
-	Concatenate two given lists head1 and head2 into a list head. head1 and/or head2 may be empty.
-	A linked list head is given which is sorted. Insert a given element in the list head so that after insertion, the list head is also sorted.
