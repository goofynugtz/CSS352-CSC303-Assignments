# Assignment 9

1. Write a C program to perform the following operations in a BST:
-	Insert a key value in a tree (iterative logic)
-	Insert a key value in a tree (recursive logic)
-	Delete a key value from the tree
-	Search a key value and return its node address (if found)
-	Traverse the tree
-	Display the depth of the tree

2. Given the inorder and postorder traversal sequence, write a C program to construct the binary tree.

3. Given values ‘x’ & ‘y’ write a C code to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) node of two key values ‘x’ & ‘y’ in a BST.  
[Hint: you may try to write a recursive algorithm; the trick is to find such a node which has one of the keys in the left subtree and the other in the right subtree while descending down from the root node]

4. Given a binary tree display it’s key sequence following breadth first search (bfs). 
[Hint: use queue data structure]
