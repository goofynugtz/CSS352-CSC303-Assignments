# Assingment 5

1. Write a menu driven program in C to perform following data structure operations on linear queue using array. 
- ENQUEUE 
- DEQUEUE
- queueFRONT [Extract the information from FRONT of the queue]
- queueREAR [Extract the information from REAR of the queue]
- queueCOUNT [Return the number of elements in the queue]
- DISPLY [Display all the elements stored in a queue]


2. Write a menu driven program in C to perform following data structure operations on circular queue using array. 
- ENQUEUE 
- DEQUEUE
- queueFRONT [Extract the information from FRONT of the queue]
- queueREAR [Extract the information from REAR of the queue]
- queueCOUNT [Return the number of elements in the queue]
- DISPLAY [Display all the elements stored in a queue]


3. Write a menu driven program in C to implement queue as an ADT using linked list   
  [Consider the following data structure operations during your implementation]. 
- ENQUEUE 
- DEQUEUE
- queueFRONT [Extract the information from FRONT of the queue]
- queueREAR [Extract the information from REAR of the queue]
- queueCOUNT [Return the number of elements in the queue]
- emptyQUEUE
- fullQUEUE
- DISPLAY [Display all the elements stored in a queue]
- destroyQUEUE [Delete all the data elements from the queue and release its memory, then deletes and release memory space for the head node pointer]


4. Given a stack S and a queue Q, write procedures FILLQ_WITHS which will empty the contents 
of the stack S and insert them into the queue Q and FILLS_WITHQ which will fill the stack S 
with the elements deleted from the queue Q. Implement the procedures with S and Q having 
an array representation
