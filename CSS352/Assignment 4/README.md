1. Write a menu driven program in C to perform following data structure operations on stack 
using **array**:   
- CREATE 
- PUSH
- POP
- PEEK [Extract the information from top of the stack]
- PEEP [Extract ith information from top of the stack]
- UPDATE [Update ith information from the top of the stack]
- DISPLY [Display all the elements stored in a stack]

2. Write a menu driven program in C to perform following data structure operations on stack 
using **linked list**. 
- CREATE 
- PUSH
- POP
- PEEK [Extract the information from top of the stack]
- PEEP [Extract ith information from top of the stack]
- UPDATE [Update ith information from the top of the stack]
- DISPLY [Display all the elements stored in a stack]

3. Write a C program for transforming an infix expression to a postfix expression.  

4. Write a C program for evaluating a postfix expression.  

5. Write a program for transforming an infix expression to a prefix expression. [Optional]  

6. Write a program in C that takes one mathematical expression (in infix notation) and checks 
whether the opening and closing parenthesis match or not and print the correctness of the 
expression.  

7. Write a program in C to test if a string is palindrome using STACK
